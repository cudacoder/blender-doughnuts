# Blender Doughnuts

![Coffee and some doughnuts](https://i.imgur.com/2pe5Z12.jpg)

A simple Blender tutorial project which contains 3D doughnuts and coffee on a table.  
This is an attempt to follow [BlenderGuru](https://www.blenderguru.com/)'s incredible [Blender Beginner Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VT5oZndzj68&list=PLjEaoINr3zgHs8uzT3yqe4iHGfkCmMJ0P).

This repo contains some of the Python helper scripts, materials and refrences I used during this project, and six versions I've rendered during the modelling process.
